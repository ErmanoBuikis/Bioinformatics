### Protein Mass Calculator


Proteins are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, providing structure to cells and organisms, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific 3D structure that determines its activity.

### Requisites:
  - python3
  - fileinput .fasta


Example usage in terminal:

 _python3 single_seq_fasta_weight.py gfp.txt_



The script take input of FASTA file with only 1 sequence 
and return the weight of that sequence.
