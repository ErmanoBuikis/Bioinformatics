### GC-content description
 
In molecular biology and genetics, GC-content (or guanine-cytosine content) is the percentage of nitrogenous bases in a DNA or RNA molecule that are either guanine (G) or cytosine (C). This measure indicates the proportion of G and C bases out of an implied four total bases, also including adenine and thymine in DNA and adenine and uracil in RNA.

GC-content may be given for a certain fragment of DNA or RNA or for an entire genome. When it refers to a fragment, it may denote the GC-content of an individual gene or section of a gene (domain), a group of genes or gene clusters, a non-coding region, or a synthetic oligonucleotide such as a primer.


GC regions are present in:
	- Large non-coding regions
	- Coding regions
	- Non-coding regions that precede a gene



GC Content applications

1. Find locations of long non-coding regions.

2. Collect GC content values over these regions and compute the average and standard
deviation over these values.

3. Collect GC content over the non-complement genes. A more thorough study would
also use the complements, but as there are almost 4000 genes this is not required
here.

4. Compute the average and standard deviation over the GC content values in these
coding regions.

5. Collect GC content data for the 50 nucleotides that precede the coding region.

6. Compute the average and standard deviation over these values.

7. Compare the statistics for these three designated regions.
